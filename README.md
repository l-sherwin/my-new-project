# AI Accident Investigation

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The operationalisation of AI/Machine Learning in transportation and other industries has grown faster than the maturity of testing and risk management. Current accident investigation techniques are based on understanding deterministic models and may be inadequate for understanding non-deterministic machine behaviour. 

## Background

The operationalisation of AI/Machine Learning in transportation and other industries has grown faster than the maturity of testing and risk management. Current accident investigation techniques are based on understanding deterministic models and may be inadequate for understanding non-deterministic machine behaviour. 

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* problem 1
Need to understand how AI/Machine Learning was implemented.
* problem 2
Need a structured process for personnel to follow to build a model of the function, purpose and developemt of the AI/Machine Learning.
* problem 3
What is our understanding of how risk emerges in a learning system?
* problem 4
How do we apply controls in a learning system to prevent unwanted learning, while not restricting performance improvement and adaptation.

## How is it used?

The solution should encapsulate a process that could be employed to provide independence accident investigation findings and recommendations.

## Data sources and AI methods

To develop a process would require input from the AI community / software and sensor developers to understand how to interogate the software to understand the strengths and weaknesses of it as a controller.

## Challenges

Access to IP for vehicle software control systems.

## What next?

Project would need input from vehicle control systems employing AI/Machine Learning
